Use Cases / Context
===================

In some advanced configurations, stock orderpoints could have a
different replenishment location than the warehouse 'Stock Location'.

In order to get that different replenishment location by default, a new
field should be necessary on warehouses to define that new default
value.

Configuration
=============

To set a different default location for new orderpoints:

#. Go to Inventory > Settings > Warehouse #. Enable 'Storage Locations'
and 'Multi-Step Routes'

#. Go to Inventory > Warehouse Management > Warehouses #. Pick the one
you want to modify #. In the 'Warehouse Configuration' tab > Default
Orderpoint Location, select the one you want as default for new
orderpoints.
